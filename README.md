Solution for AccuKnox problem statements

1. **Django Signals Task**

   This project demonstrates how Django signals work. It includes a basic setup to show the default behavior of Django signals in terms of synchronization, threading, and database transactions. The project features:
   
   - A Django application with a simple model.
   - Signal handling that logs thread information and transaction status.
   - Code to test and verify the behavior of signals.
